USAGE
=====

The 'find_companies' script will search through a csv file containing company data
using regular expressions defined in a configuration file. The data
which matches (see below ) these criteria will be output to the console 
and can be redirected to a file. The input csv file is provided by Companies 
House and it's contents are detailed at:

http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html 
 
To use the 'find_companies' script the following commmand line syntax is required:
 
find_companies <companies data file name> <configuration file name>

A typical invokation of this script where the output is captured to file would
be as follows:

perl find_companies.pl c:\find_companies\input.txt c:\find_companies\criteria.txt > c:\find_companies\results.csv
 
The format of the configuration file is as follows where each line
contains one or more regular expressions which the data in the 
specified field ( column ) could match. The contents of a specified 
field must match a least one of the criteria specified for that
field to be output and all fields for which criteria are specified must 
match at least one of the match criteria specified for that field for
any data for a specific company to be output ( see OutputRow ).
 
 Column Number , Regex 1, Regex 2,....Regex n

e.g.

0,^ITECCO,STRAT		! CompanyName
6,.*			! PostTown
7,.*			! County
8,.*			! Country
11,Active		! CompanyStatus
26,.*			! SICCode1
27,.*			! SICCode2
28,.*			! SICCode3
29,.*			! SICCode4
 
This example configuration file will output the following data:
 
The company name when this starts with 'ITECCO' or contains string  'STRAT'
The town in which the company is registered ( this is always displayed as '.*' matches all strings.
The county in which the company is registered
The country in which the company is registered
The conmpany status if this is 'Active'
The first SIC code used to classify the company
The second SIC code used to classify the company
The third SIC code used to classify the company
The fourth SIC code used to classify the company
 
This scripts does limited checks on command line arguments and the contents of
the configuration file specified. It will exit displaying an error message if an
issue with either of these is found.
